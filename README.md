# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview

This project is part of the Data Mining and Analytics class (Data 144) at UC Berkeley, where we participated in a Kaggle competition aimed at predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. Our model was among the top 20 most accurate in the class, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in handling this classic data science problem.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, typically used in machine learning and data science. It includes various features such as passenger age, sex, class, fare, and others. The primary objective is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed.
3. The main script `titanic_survival_prediction.py` contains the preprocessing steps, model building, and prediction process.
4. Run the script to train the model and make predictions.

## Model and Approach

The project utilizes advanced data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and categorical encoding. We use an ensemble learning approach, combining Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression models. This combination leverages the strengths of each model to improve the overall accuracy of our predictions.

## Key Outcomes

- Our model achieved a high level of accuracy, 0.80838, placing it among the top 20 in our class competition.
- The project demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble learning techniques in improving predictive performance.

## Acknowledgments
